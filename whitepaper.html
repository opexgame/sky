       <h3>☁️ SKYPUFFS – SKYTOKEN WHITE PAPER</h3>
<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> October 5, 2025</p>

<h3>🌐 SKY TOKEN ECONOMY</h3>
<p>
SkyToken (“SKY”) is a digital token with no utility, no promises, and no roadmap — created solely to entertain the Skypuffs Galaxy.<br><br>
SKY represents nothing more than what it is: a meme drifting through Web3.<br>
No secret team, no hidden plan, no guaranteed profit — just fun, color, and a touch of controlled chaos.<br><br>
SKY has no economic function, intrinsic value, or expected return. No reasonable expectations should be made regarding:<br><br>
• Any financial return, dividend, interest, or appreciation in value;<br>
• Any utility within a future ecosystem (whether it exists or not);<br>
• Any potential exchange for goods, services, money, or hugs.<br><br>
SKY is useless by design — and that’s precisely what makes it charming.
</p>

<h3>🚫 SKY IS NOT AND DOES NOT AIM TO BE:</h3>
<p>
• A medium of exchange accepted by the public for goods or services;<br>
• A right to products, voting power, or benefits within Skypuffs or any other entity;<br>
• A representation of money, electronic currency, or a financial security;<br>
• A financial market product, share, bond, derivative, or similar instrument;<br>
• A claim to yield, revenue, commissions, or any form of distribution;<br>
• Redeemable, convertible, or exchangeable for cash or any other digital asset.
</p>

<h3>💬 NO PROMISES, NO COMMITMENTS</h3>
<p>
There are no guarantees regarding the listing of SKY on any exchange.<br>
If that ever happens, it will probably be a cosmic accident.<br>
The Skypuffs team has no plan to make the token "moon" — but if it ever does, it will only be thanks to market faith and exceptionally good karma.
</p>

<h3>☁️ IN SUMMARY</h3>
<p>
The Skypuffs White Paper is a free, evolving, and non-contractual document.<br>
It is not a business plan — it’s a manifesto for those who prefer to laugh rather than speculate.<br><br>
Here, nothing is guaranteed, and everything is possible — except maybe gravity. 🚀
